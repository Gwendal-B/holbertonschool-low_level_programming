 into account
 In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you t have to push them to your repo (if you do we t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
 The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
 t forget to push your header file~Donwondon
